# How to play 
Move the character using arrow keys.
The rules of the game of Legend of SeePlusia are as follows.
 You begin at Enchanted Forest on the rst day with 30 apples.
 You have to save Prince Lazy who is held captive at Wizard's Castle.
 At each location you can only go in one of four directions: north, south,
east, west.
 If a direction is not shown on the map, it's an invalid move, e.g. north
from Marsh of the Undead. An invalid move uses up the move and
consumes one apple.
 A valid move consumes the number of apples as drawn on the arrow,
e.g. to travel from Enchanted Forest to Swamps of Despair, two apples
are consumed.
 Before rescuing the prince, you have to collect 3 Objectos crystals from
the indicated locations.
 An Objectos crystal is automaticaly retrieved when you arrive at its
location.
 Once you retrieve a crystal, it is no longer present at that location.
 If you arrive at Sands of Quick, you slowly sink into quicksand and die
and the game is Lost.
 You cannot move past Bridge of Death to Wizard's Castle unless you
have all three crystals.
 Once you reach Wizard's Castle, the Prince is rescued and the game is
Won.
 If you run out of food before rescuing the prince, you die of starvation
and the game is Lost.
